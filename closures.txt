**Closure is when a function can remember and access its lexical scope
even when it’s invoked outside its lexical scope.
Closures can trip us up, for instance with loops, if we’re not careful to
recognize them and how they work. But they are also an immensely
powerful tool, enabling patterns like modules in their various forms.**
